On the 27th of March, the Government established the Special Fund for the Management of the Coronavirus Pandemic, with approximately 1 billion US. The EU and US have also contributed, and the Government has called for businesses and other actors to add to the fund. In addition to health services, financial support will be provided. Support will be given to citizens who lose their jobs, as well as suspending social security contributions for all citizens. The Ministry of Economy, Finance and Administration Reform announced there would be increased financing for SMEs, which will enable financing resources for companies whose cash flow has deteriorated due to COVID. This policy covers 95% of the amount of the loan and thus allows banks to quickly set up exceptional overdrafts to finance the working capital needs of the concerned enterprises. The interministerial Committee has been intensely monitoring the price of goods and services, particularly food, and has warned of sanctions against fraud and price speculation. On 17 March 2020, the Moroccan Central Bank decided to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points to 2%.
