<pre><code>===========

1.  Scope: What to expect from the CRM 
    ----------------------------------</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Monitor differs from other multi-dimensional risk databases (such as the INFORM risk index</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><strong>) in that it compiles real-time and forward-looking risk information, together with static descriptions of historical vulnerability to compound risk.</strong> In so doing, the CRM aims to complement existing risk tracking systems (by focusing on potential compounding effects) rather than replace them. In designing the Monitor, the team focused on ensuring a careful balance between complexity (in beginning to explore the interactions between different dimensions of compound risk) and simplicity (in ensuring the outputs of the Monitor are intuitive enough to support decision-makers). See box 2 for a short description of the design principles that guided the development of the CRM. The Monitor and its methodology are therefore a live resource, open to continuous updates and refinement as new data sources become available and based on feedback from both technical experts and potential users (see Section 2.3).</p>
<p>Before delving into the methodology used in compiling the CRM, it is important to clarify how the tool should (and should not) be used.</p>
<p><strong>What the Monitor DOES:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p><strong>It provides a global overview of country-level compound risk.</strong> The CRM does so by drawing on the best available sources of risk information across a range of dimensions of compound risk (six in total) to provide high-level risk summaries for both underlying vulnerability and emerging threats, as well as providing overall alert flags. In addition, the tool aims to encourage decision makers to look at risks holistically – providing multidimensional risk information to actors that might otherwise focus on singular risk factors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It acts as a simple alert system, flagging any areas of potential concern that display strong signals and that therefore warrant increased vigilance.</strong> Using the default method, flags are raised whenever one (or more) indicator within a given dimension has exceeded a high-risk threshold. This means that the CRM is inherently proactive – a flag will be raised even in instances where all other indicators within the dimension are not considered high risk. For this reason, users are encouraged to consider and probe the diversity of indicators scores – doing so will be facilitated through use of an interactive dashboard that accompanies it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What the Monitor is NOT intended for:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p><strong>It is NOT a modelling exercise. Nor is it an attempt at precisely projecting overall levels of compound risk.</strong> The Monitor highlights countries and regions where concerns exist relating to one or (or multiple) dimensions. In this way, the CRM is designed as a flagging system. This differs from systems aimed at precisely quantifying the timing and magnitude of future risks. Decision-makers should see the CRM as a high-level guidance tool, to be complemented by supplemental and more in-depth risk analytics to inform specific policy and operational decisions. For example, the CRM cannot substitute a detailed sub-national risk profile or a probabilistic model that quantifies the likely magnitude and frequency of natural hazards in a given country over different time periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It is NOT designed with the aim of ranking countries.</strong> Given its reliance on a flagging system, like-for-like rankings of countries within the CRM is not considered appropriate. Instead, users should prioritize use of the tool to observe how a country’s risk changes over time, as well as providing a broad overview of the geographic spread of compound risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It is NOT meant to replace sector-specific risk monitoring tools.</strong> The CRM collates information from a range of sector-specific risk monitoring tools. These are used as source indicators that feed into the CRM model (with high and low risk thresholds assigned to each). While the Monitor presents summarized risk profiles across all respective sectors, they are not meant to replace them. Through the dashboard, the CRM will point users to relevant sector-specific risk tools and data repositories for further insights.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It is NOT a complete measure of compound risk.</strong> Risk is decidedly multi-dimensional. Capturing and quantifying all possible risks that a country faces is an impossible task. Instead, the CRM focuses on six distinct dimensions of compound risk. These are used as lenses through which levels of risk facing a given country are inferred. Future work on the CRM will focus on quantifying precise interactions and weights between these dimensions and may explore the integration of additional dimensions.</p></li>

<td><p><strong>Box 2: Design principles</strong></p>
<p>The design of the CRM was guided by four key design principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Simplicity.</strong> Given the large number of data sources underlying the CRM, simplicity is paramount to ensure that risk information is easy to communicate and interpret. Users should be able to quickly identify the main dimensions that are contributing to a country’s level of compound risk. The planned user interface, in the form of a web-based interactive dashboard, will give users access toa wide variety of descriptive information and visualizations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility.</strong> The CRM has a range of potential users, each with their own informational needs. Accordingly, many aspects of the Monitor are designed so as to be easily tailored to users’ needs. One example is the choice of high/low thresholds used for classifying indicators and risk dimensions. In addition, users may want to place higher emphasis on particular dimensions, or isolate upcoming threats that may be of interest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disaggregating risk information across time-periods.</strong> Decision-makers often require information related to a range of timescales, ranging from historical trends to long-term projections of future risk. With this in mind, the Monitor is designed in a way that intuitively showcases levels of compound risk related to a range of time-periods of interest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Building on existing multidimensional risk indices.</strong> Whenever possible, the CRM builds on existing risk monitoring initiatives, aligning dimensions, indicators and aggregation methods where appropriate and adding new dimensions that suit the needs and purpose of the CRM. In particular, most multi-dimensional risk indices provide static snapshots of existing (or systemic risk). The CRM adds notable value in combining these with indicators that reflect real-time and forward-looking indicators to provide an outlook on emerging threats conditions. Furthermore, it combines information from underlying vulnerability and emerging threats to provide a gauge of overall alertness needed in responding to given risk dimensions.</p></li>
</ol></td>

</table>
<p><strong>Development and interpretation of any risk monitoring system requires an understanding of the considerable technical challenges involved in tracking risk.</strong> In particular, there are two main methodological challenges that affect the design of the Compound Risk Monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>First and foremost, data availability.</strong> Risk is inherently multi-dimensional, with no one indicator able to holistically cover all aspects of risk. With this in mind, the CRM draws on a range of existing indices that aggregate large pools of indicators across different risk dimensions and dimensions. Inevitably, not all sources of underlying data offer the same level of robustness and some components are inherently better at comprehensively reflecting local risk conditions than others. For example, while there is a relative abundance of real-time information on exposure to natural hazards and occurrence of conflict events, few resources exist to track household-level socio-economic vulnerability. In addition, risk information is geographically patchy, with few data sources providing full global coverage. The CRM therefore aggregates information from a range of data sources. This often means that the reliability of respective dimensions of compound risk used in the CRM will vary at different spatial scales, requiring careful interpretation of the underlying metrics that feed into it. For example, FEWSNET provides a comprehensive assessments of food security conditions in the 30 countries it covers. Yet, outside of this, analysts are typically reliant on alternative proxies to assess real-time conditions, many of which are far less reliable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lastly, different methods for data aggregation can result in vastly different risk outcomes</strong>. Given that tracking of compound risk requires multiple sources of information, choice of how to combine and weight different indicators is paramount. This applies not only to how individual dimensions are represented, but interactions between them. For example, deciding whether certain groupings of dimensions (e.g. conflict, macro-fiscal dynamics and food security) should be weighted differently to others (e.g. COVID and natural hazards) requires judgement calls in the absence of robust evidence. This is particularly relevant for any attempts at modelling or predicting compound risk (a task the CRM does not attempt to do).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In addition to these challenges, it is important to recognize that while representing factors associated with a single risk dimension (e.g. natural hazard risk) comes with a degree of uncertainty, uncertainties in compound risk are inherently much higher.</strong> This owes not only to the fact that uncertainties will additively accumulate as individual dimensions are combined in the CRM. It also recognizes that little is currently known about how risk factors amplify/diminish when compounded. Care therefore needs to be taken in communicating outputs from any multi-dimensional risk monitoring system – with clear guidance on scope of the tool.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Unpacking compound risk in the CRM</h2>
<p><strong>There currently is no standard definition of compound risk (Pescaroli and Alexander 2018)</strong> and the term is frequently used synonymously with concepts such as ‘cascading’, ‘complex’ or ‘multi-dimensional’ risk. At its most basic, compound risk results from ‘the combination of two or more events’ (IPCC 2012). It refers to the types of situations where a single hazard interacts with underlying vulnerabilities and in turn influences the extent and impact of secondary or tertiary hazards (Cutter 2018). A recent paper by Zscheischler et al. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> offer a useful typology of compound risks, anchored in climate science. Compound risks include: i) the occurrence of multiple threats (either the same or different types of threats) in quick succession; ii) the occurrence of multiple threats in close geographic proximity; and iii) rapid increases in vulnerability leading to heightened sensitivity to future threats (including threats that would otherwise not lead to a crisis).</p>
<p><strong>Compound risk is therefore not only a function of exposure to multiple hazards, but also of the underlying vulnerabilities of the people and communities affected by them</strong>. For example, socio-economic vulnerability is often considered an outcome of compounding risk – perhaps a result of two back-to-back cyclones affecting an area. Yet, a sharp increase in poverty can also generate compounding effects by severely weakening household-level capacities to cope with even minor shocks and stressors that would otherwise not lead to major impacts/crises.</p>
<p><strong>The CRM breaks down compound risk into underlying dimensions, each representing risk conditions, threats or vulnerabilities that have the potential to contribute to compound risk</strong>. There is no standard framework for compound risk across the risk literature or other risk monitoring initiatives<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. The CRM team therefore focused on: i) dimensions that are commonly referred to across a range of similar risk monitoring initiatives; ii) dimensions that are relevant to the Bank’s mandate and operational interests as highlighted in the 2018 GCRP Board paper; and iii) dimensions for which there is sufficient data availability in tracking changing risk conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Based on these criteria, the CRM separates compound risk into six core dimensions: i) natural hazards, ii) food security, iii) conflict and fragility, iv) macro-fiscal dynamics, vi) socio-economic vulnerability, and vii) health risks</strong><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><strong>.</strong> While each is considered distinct, there are inherently strong overlaps across the six dimensions. Indeed, each individual dimension is multi-dimensional in nature, with some degree of inevitable overlap across other dimensions. While this would complicate any attempt to model compound risk as part of a single composite index, the fact that the CRM is based on a flagging system is intended to avert concerns associated with such interactions.</p>
<p>Below we provide further insight into the rationale and scope of the various dimensions underlying the CRM. For a full list of the indicators that feature under each component refer to Section 2.3, Step 1 below.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Breaking compound risk into six dimensions</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: The graphic above highlights the conceptual overlap between the six dimensions of compound risk selected and overall compound risk. In reality, there are more overlaps across individual dimensions.</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p><strong>Natural hazards:</strong> Natural hazards are perhaps the threat most typically associated with compound risk. They also feature prominently as core dimensions in a wide range of risk monitoring efforts, including INFORM, ND-GAIN and FAO/WFP’s Early Warning Analysis. There are many examples of back-to-back (or overlapping) hazards that have resulted in complex crisis. The short span between cyclones Kenneth and Idai in Mozambique (2019) and the more recent successive occurrence of hurricanes Eta and Iota in Nicaragua (2020) are good examples of the devastation that natural hazards can inflict on societies and economies. In the context of the CRM, we categorize natural hazards across climate-related events such as floods, droughts and cyclones; geophysical events such as earthquakes and tsunamis; as well as pest-related events such as the locust outbreak currently affecting the Horn of Africa.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Food security:</strong> As highlighted above, the CRM defines compound risk in relation to the interaction of both hazards and underlying vulnerabilities. In this sense, while food insecurity can often result as consequence of specific threats (such as natural hazards or conflict), high levels of food insecurity can significantly increase a community’s sensitivity and vulnerability to other compounding threats. Food insecurity within the CRM is defined as contexts where people do not have adequate physical, social or economic access to food. This holistic definition recognizes that there is no one-metric of food insecurity, requiring multi-dimensional measures covering all aspects related to access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food. Food security also features as a core dimension of both the ND-GAIN, FAO/WFP EWA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conflict and fragility:</strong> Fragile and conflict-affected states are among the contexts with the highest potential for compound risk. In particular, coping capacity is often limited, with weakened country systems unable to respond to shocks, exacerbating impacts on lives and livelihoods. The CRM considers both violent conflict – reflecting widespread and intense violence across many parts of the country, as well as institutional fragility – reflecting countries facing deep institutional crises, that have very poor transparency and government accountability, or that have weak institutional capacity. The CRM’s definition of conflict and fragility mirrors the World Bank’s classification of fragile and conflict-affected situations<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Macro-fiscal dynamics:</strong> Economic shocks (and a country’s fiscal response) can have large impacts on a country’s capacity to deal with future risk as well as its development trajectory. In the context of the CRM, the macro-financial and fiscal risk dimension refers to the general status of a country’s economy and the sustainability of fiscal measures adopted. It focuses on aspects related to public sector, corporate, monetary, debt sustainability, banking and market-related risks<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.. Given the lack of suitable preexisting metrics for tracking underlying vulnerability and emerging threats related to macro-fiscal risk, the CRM will opt for a phased approach. The macro-fiscal dynamics dimension will first be based on a modified version of the EIU Risk Briefing score (further details on the proposed steps are outlined in Figure 1). As a second step, the CRM team will seek to replace (or complement) inputs from the EIU with an in-house metric design in collaboration with a variety of Bank units (including CROCR, MTI, FCI and Prospects).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Socio-economic vulnerability:</strong> The inclusion of socio-economic vulnerability in the CRM recognizes that compound risk arises from the interactions of hazards and underlying vulnerabilities. Indeed, a compound event can occur precisely because a community has experienced a rapid deterioration in livelihood outcomes and/or coping capacity – meaning that the ability to deal with emerging threats is severely compromised (even for threats that would otherwise not lead to crisis). To complement use of macro-level inputs, the CRM also monitors socio-economic vulnerability, leveraging the World Bank’s unique sources of real-time data on household-level dynamics – including poverty projections, inequality level estimates and remote phone-surveys<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health-systems, disease outbreaks and response (‘Health risk’ hereafter):</strong> The ongoing COVID pandemic is a prime example of the potentially devastating impacts of disease outbreaks on economies and societies. With this in mind, the CRM features a measure of: i) the effectiveness of a country’s healthcare system; ii) exposure to ongoing (or potential) health-related threats, namely epidemics and pandemics; and iii) the immediate implications of response options (or lack thereof) on a country’s ability to contain an ongoing threat. Given the ongoing global pandemic, COVID-related indicators feature heavily in the CRM’s current iteration. However, the CRM also reflects the overall status of a country’s health system. Additionally, this risk dimension will continue to be updated, especially as the impacts of COVID are expected to diminish over time – through 2021 and beyond.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The CRM is designed to allow some degree of flexibility and the remit of each dimension (and composition of indicators within each) may therefore change gradually over time as the nature of the global risk landscape continues to evolve.</strong> For example, the current emphasis on COVID-19 and its secondary impacts is likely to be reassesses over time as the pandemic evolves. To guide this process, the team plans to review the scope of each dimension (and indicators) quarterly, seeking inputs from relevant experts across the institution.</p>
</div>
<div id="steps-in-designing-the-crm" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Steps in designing the CRM</h2>
<p><strong>While the CRM provides separate country-level assessments for underlying vulnerability and emerging threats, the same simple multi-step process is used in calculating scores for both</strong><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>To start with, each dimension of compound risk is broken down in a series of indicators</strong> sourced from a range of internal WB risk databases and, when not available, from external sources. Indicators are grouped separately according to whether they reflect Underlying Vulnerability or Emerging Threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Each indicator is assigned a threshold deemed to represent ‘high risk’. A numeric score is then generated using a bounded min/max normalization procedure</strong>, with bounds assigned to upper (and in some cases lower) risk thresholds<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. Thresholds are typically assigned via expert consensus and elicitation. In cases where widely agreed thresholds are not available percentiles are used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next, indicators within each dimension are grouped together and aggregated.</strong> In accordance with the CRM’s flagging system, aggregation is typically done by selecting the maximum value across the suite of grouped indicators<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. In cases where there are clear differences in indicator quality, or where data has limited geographic coverage, a hierarchy of inputs is assigned. The process results in a score ranging from 0 (no risk) to 10 (high risk) for each risk dimension (separate scores are assigned for Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Threats).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An Overall Alert Flag is also generated for each risk dimension by combining inputs from the</strong> Underlying Vulnerability <strong>and Emerging Threat scores.</strong> This is done using a geometric mean of the two inputs (similarly resulting in a score ranging from 0-10). Alert Levels are grouped into three categories with scores ranging from 7-10 deemed high alert, scores between 5-7 deemed medium alert status and scores between 0-5 considered low alert status.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Country-level profiles are provided by summing the number of risk dimensions deemed high (or medium) risk. Three separate measures for Underlying Vulnerability, Emerging Threats and Overall Alert Flags are provided, recognizing the diversity of user needs.</strong> Country-level scores can either be generated as the sum of risk dimensions deemed high risk or a combination of high and medium risks<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. The latter is chosen as the default for the remainder of this note.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finally, expert elicitation is used to validate and complement the CRM outputs with qualitative analysis.</strong> The expertise and judgement of WB sectoral experts is an essential element of the overall CRM methodology, guiding indicator selection and aggregation as well as the identification of appropriate thresholds. To help manage the complexity of the analysis, we strive for methodological simplicity, but this inevitably leads to a loss of accuracy, with the risk of not capturing all areas of interest. Expert elicitation methods can help to circumvent these limitations.</p></li>

<p><img src="media/image2.png" style="width:6.56784in;height:2.98494in" /></p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: Indicator selection</strong></p>
<p><strong>To begin with, suitable indicators are selected to populate all six risk dimensions included in the CRM (with indicators grouped separately for</strong> Underlying Vulnerability <strong>and Emerging Threats).</strong> The CRM team worked with experts across key GPs to identify suitable indicators, alongside an extensive review of literature and relevant multi-dimensional risk indexes. The selection was guided by a number of factors, including: (i) whether commonly-used risk metrics already exist; ii) whether relevant indicators are already in use by WB teams; (iii) levels of geographic coverage and data quality; and (iv) frequency of updates. Whenever possible, the team sought to use existing multi-dimensional risk metrics, such as the INFORM Risk Index (see Box 3 for details). In cases where a robust multi-dimensional index is unavailable, the team identified a basket of relevant source indicators. In many cases, proxy indicators are used (particularly for emerging threats).</p>
<p><strong>Box 3: Scope and overlap with the INFORM Risk index</strong></p>
<p><strong>Below we provide a brief summary of considerations in selecting key indicators used to populate the six dimensions of compound risk in the CRM</strong> (further highlighted in Table 1 below). For more details on aggregation procedures and thresholds used in each dimension of compound risk, as well as notes on suitability and alternatives see Annex Tables 1-6.</p>

| | <strong>Rationale:</strong> A range of natural hazard indexes exist, providing a number of options for use in the CRM. Given the CRM’s close alignment with the INFORM Risk Index – particularly for measures of underlying vulnerability – use of INFORM’s Natural Multi-Hazard Index was considered most appropriate. The index compiles exposure and vulnerability metrics on a range of hazards including earthquakes, tsunami, drought, flood and heatwaves. In addition, the CRM makes use of extensive information on exposure from the WB’s ThinkHazard! Database. Thresholds are assigned by the GCRP team in consultation with GFDRR. | - <a href="https://www.gdacs.org/">GDACS Live Hazard Tracker. Updates: Daily</a>. <em>(L1)</em> |
| | | |
| | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> There are a wide range of natural hazard indexes. Prominent metrics include ND-GAIN, Global Risk Data Platform (UNEP) and the World Risk Report. However, none are considered as comprehensive as the INFORM risk, which is widely used by other risk monitoring initiatives. | <strong>Data hierarchy:</strong> Level 1: All source indicators are assigned Level 1 |
| | | |
| | | <strong>Rationale:</strong> While there are many real-time and forecast-based tracking tools for natural hazards, few compile multi-hazard information to provide a snap-shot of emerging threats. Those that do, are often focused on specific regions (e.g. Europe and North America). Under the current iteration of the CRM, information from three mains sources is used. This includes country-level seasonal risk profiles using forecasts derived from Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI). The forecast operates on a 2-3 month time horizons – with the CRM’s index primarily focus on above or below average precipitation. Forecasts also provide estimates of expected impacts from ENSO events. In addition to the seasonal forecast, the CRM makes use of a number of other real-time hazard trackers. This includes inputs from the EU’s Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), INFORM’s Natural Hazards Crisis tracker and FAO’s Desert Locust Monitor – all of which monitor the severity and impact of ongoing hazard events. |

| | | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> In addition to the three live hazard tracking tools, a number of other options exist including feeds from the USGS, Pacific Disaster Centre and NOAA. Most have similar coverage and breadth of monitoring systems. To monitor seasonal risks, the CRM currently makes use of a prototype index tracking the proportion of land covered by above or below average expected rainfall. The index has been developed together with Columbia University. Going forward the CRM will make use of a more advanced module that will combine information from the seasonal forecast with forecasts for hurricane basin activity and flood incidence (similarly developed in conjunction with Columbia University). |

While a wide range of indicators are suitable, use of a composite index aggregating information across core dimensions of food insecurity was deemed more appropriate for the CRM. Amongst potential metrics, the World Food Programme (WFP)'s Proteus index was chosen for use in the CRM as a holistic measure of predisposed food insecurity and country-level response capacity. The variable is a multi-dimensional composite that groups indicators according to four dimensions: food availability, access, utilization and stability (see Caccavale and Giuffrida 2020). While the index is comprehensive, it was last updated in 2018 -- with little indication as to whether the database will be maintained going forward. Consideration will be given to updating use of the Proteus Index going forward (or selecting suitable alternatives) together with the Agriculture and Food GP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |</code> |

| | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> A number of alternative metrics were considered, including the Ending Rural Hunger Index, Hidden Hunger Index, Global Food Security Index and WFP Hunger Maps. Another option would be to use current FEWS NET IPC ratings or an average of classifications over a set period (such a one year). In consultation with the Agriculture and Food GP, few were deemed to have the coverage or depth required compared with the Proteus Index. | Updates: Ad hoc</a>. <em>(L1)</em> |

| | | |
| | | - Level 1: FEWS NET, FAO/WFP EWH |
| | | |
| | | - Level 2: Food price volatility |
| | | |
| | | <strong>Rationale:</strong> By far the best-known measure of emerging food insecurity comes from the FEWS NET early warning system. FEWS NET provides periodic and comprehensive multi-agency overviews of current and future food insecurity conditions across 30 monitored countries. In order to ensure alignment with internal WB systems, choice of indicator threshold is linked to the WB’s Crisis Response Window (CRW) Early Response Financing (ERF) trigger. The Monitor also makes use of data from FAO / WFP’s acute food insecurity early warning initiative (with similar coverage to FEWS NET). Outside of IPC-classified countries, there are few multi-dimensional indexes that provide similar levels of detail. One alternative is to use food price information, for which geographic coverage of information is far larger. Food price inflation and volatility are considered acceptable proxies for emerging food insecurity conditions and is used in the CRM in countries where there are no data alternatives. Data and thresholds for food prices are gathered from the WB’s Food Price Monitor. |
| | | |
| | | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> Alternative food price volatility metrics were considered in the form of FAO’s GIEWS and FPMA metrics. However, the WB’s internal metrics were deemed better aligned with thresholds used by Ag GP. Similarly, use of WFP’s mVAM data may add value going forward. |

| | <strong>Rationale:</strong> There are a large number of conflict and fragility indexes provided by academia, civil society and multi-lateral agencies. Given the need for analytical rigour and to ensure internal consistency within the World Bank, the CRM makes use of the Fragile and Conflict-affected Situations’ list as a primary source of data. The metric reflects two main factors: countries affected by violent conflict; and countries with high levels of institutional and social fragility. Choice of the indicator and threshold was done in close consultation with FCV. | |
| | | <strong>Data hierarchy:</strong> Level 1: All source indicators are assigned Level 1 |
| | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> A number of alternatives were considered. Four main sources include: the Fragile States Index (FSI), a composite measure widely used by international organisations; the Global Peace Index and INFORM’s Conflict Risk Index, similar multi-dimensional indexes; and the World Bank’s Conflict structural model. Given the need to ensure accuracy of assessment and alignment with official World Bank classifications, none were considered as comprehensive or as widely-used as the FCS list. Going forward, the Monitor will seek to align its metrics with FCV’s Global and Regional Conflict Risk Monitor. | |
| | | <strong>Rationale:</strong> Monitoring or predicting of conflict and fragility-related conditions remains a considerable challenge. Given the uncertainties with many forecasting tools, the CRM currently focuses on observed data across three primary indicators – each tied closely to the WB’s FCS list. The first is fatalities related to political disorder and events using the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project database (ACLED). ACLED is a widely used and respected resource, monitoring fatalities on a daily basis. The second is political disturbance measured via the Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance dataset (REIGN). In particular, REIGN captures countries where an irregular election or coup have recently taken place. The CRM makes use of the dataset to flag imminent occurrence of elections in fragile or conflict-affected countries. Lastly, a metric for large deviations in forcibly displaced people is included as measured by UNHCR. Given difficulties with tracking displacement in real-time, the CRM measures changes in 2019 movement compared with a five-year baseline. Use of the three indicators to reflect emerging conflict and fragility risk has a number of limitations. In particular, institutional fragility is challenging to reflect accurately, and additional metrics will be considered over time in consultation with FCV. |

| | | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> The GCRP team considered a number of alternatives. In particular, UCDP’s Battle-Related Deaths database serves as a useful complement to ACLED. However, the database only includes global coverage commencing October 2020, making it difficult to compare against historical baselines. Going forward, a combination of ACLED and UCDP data sources may be adopted. Related to institutional fragility, the main alternative is INFORM’s Severity Index. This metric tracks the severity and status of existing crisis events (with the ability to isolate political and fragility-related events). INFORM is well respected and used by a range of development organizations. Its inclusion within future iterations of the CRM will be actively considered together with the FCV team. In addition, ACAPS and the IRC’s Watchlist provide similar forward-looking fragility outlooks – though neither were deemed to be well matched to the CRM’s current setup. Over time, choice of the CRM’s metrics will align with FCV’s Global and Regional Conflict Risk Monitor (currently under development) |

| | <strong>Rationale:</strong> Few holistic measures of exposure and sensitivity to macro-fiscal shocks exist – especially considering the CRM’s need for global coverage. With that in mind, the CRM makes use of the EIU’s <a href="http://viewswire.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=RKArticleVW3&amp;article_id=485802032&amp;country_id=1510000351&amp;refm=rkCtry&amp;page_title=Latest%20alerts">Operational Risk Score</a> as an interim measure (to be supplanted by an in-house index currently under development with support from various units across the Bank). As a widely used multi-dimensional index the EIU’s Operational Risk Score (ORS) provides a regularly updated measure of macro-fiscal conditions across a range of different components. It is comprised of 70 grouped indicators across a variety of categories, including: financial risk, foreign trade &amp; payments risk, infrastructure risk, labor market risk, legal &amp; regulatory risk, macroeconomic risk, and tax policy risk. For the purposes of the CRM, ORS categories relating to security, political stability and government effectiveness are removed from the raw measure owing to duplication with other risk dimensions within the CRM. Unlike many alternative risk metrics (such as the WB’s Macro-Financial Review index), the ORS is global in nature, profiling risk scores across 180 countries. In order to reflect levels of underlying vulnerability, the CRM makes use a 12-month ORS average. Use of an average of prior scores provides a (relatively) static assessment of the overall status of macro-fiscal conditions. Inclusion of past values may also help smooth out some of the forward-looking elements of the EIU. This is also consistent with source indicators for underlying vulnerability across other risk dimensions in the CRM – most of which update on an annual basis. | <strong>Rationale:</strong> To gauge whether macro-fiscal risk conditions within a given country are worsening (or likely to worsen in the coming months) the CRM uses a point difference between the latest monthly EIU score and average scores for the previous year (excluding the current period). This provides an overview of countries where the macro-fiscal environment has recently deteriorated relative to expected conditions over the previous year. A similar measure is used by the EIU in referring to upgrades/downgrades in macro-fiscal conditions. Given the ORS updates on a monthly basis, the metric provides a regular update on the status of emerging threats. With global coverage across a range of macro-fiscal elements, use of the ORS does not require use of a hierarchy of data inputs to fill coverage gaps (as with other multi-dimensional macro-fiscal outlooks). As mentioned previously, the |

| | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> A number of alternatives for macro-economic vulnerability were considered, including use of a wide range of indicators provided under the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects (GEP) and IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO). In particular, the WB’s Macro-Financial Risk Index (MFRI) has close overlaps with the CRM’s architecture (both on vulnerability and emerging threat elements of risk). Unfortunately, data from the MFRI is only available in 44 countries, meaning that a hierarchy of different indicators would be needed in regions with large data gaps. Alternatives such as the World Bank’s Corporate Vulnerability Index (CVI) and Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) are similarly limited – either by concerns over geographic coverage or lack of holistic assessment of macro-fiscal risk conditions. As mentioned in Section 2.2 the CRM is currently trialing an in-house to reflect macro-fiscal elements tailored specifically to the CRM’s overall framework together with inputs from MTI, FCI, CROCR and the Prospects Group. Over time, the hope is to transition to the in-house metric (either by replacing or complementing the EIU risk score) over time, once the new metric has been trialed and validated. | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> A number of variants are possible using a similar EIU setup. For example, rather than using a simple point difference, deviations could instead be calculated using a Z-score. However, given that EIU scores are currently only available for the prior 12 months (with many countries exhibiting little variation during this time period), use of a difference in values is currently preferred. Efforts are currently underway to secure access a longer timeseries of OSR data which may facilitate an update of methods. In addition, the current approach compares values for the current month relate to the 12-month mean. While this provides a decent gauge of recent upgrading/downgrading of macro-fiscal conditions, it may be of use to extent the observational period to 3 (or even 6) months. This would allow for broader terms to emerge (especially for risk conditions that materialize slowly over time or have lagged effects). However, this extended approach would only be suitable with access to longer-term OSR timeseries data (past 12 months) – something the CRM team are actively pursuing. In addition, and as mentioned previously, the CRM team will continue to trial an in-house measure for tracking emerging macro-fiscal threats. The measure will seek to extent existing WB metrics (such as the MFRI, CVI, DSA, etc.) to allow for greater geographic coverage and better fit within the scope of the CRM’s analytical framework. |

| | <strong>Rationale:</strong> As with many of the compound risk dimensions, socio-economic vulnerability is a multi-dimensional concept. It’s inclusion in the CRM recognises that compounding events are a product not only of exposure to consecutive (or overlapping) hazards, but the ability of people and communities to cope with and respond to emerging threats. Severe heightening of socio-economic vulnerabilities can often lead to compounding events, even in cases where exposure to mild overlapping threats would otherwise not lead to a disaster. With that in mind, the CRM currently makes use of the INFORM’s Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index as a composite measure comprised of traits related to deprivation, inequality, dependency, uprootedness and composition of vulnerable groups. | - <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2020/01/weodata/download.aspx">Percentage point change in unemployment rate (IMF).

| | | <strong>Rationale:</strong> Finding real-time global measures of socio-economic vulnerability is a considerable challenge – particularly those that reflect household-level conditions and coping capacities. In consulting widely with the WB’s Prospects team, Poverty and Equity GP and Development Data Group, the CRM currently comprises a basket of indicators. The first metric is country-level poverty projections. Figures are taken from the World Bank’s Macro Poverty Outlook (MPO), with forecasted percentage point differences in the proportion of people living below $1.90 chosen as a proxy for deteriorating household-level coping capacities. Percentage point differences for both 2021-2020 and 20210-2019 are used in the current iteration, recognising that the knock-on implications of increased poverty on household-level vulnerability can persist for long periods of time. In addition to poverty, inclusion of unemployment forecasts is included to factor future changes<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> in labour conditions and livelihood opportunities using the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. As with GDP inputs, percentage point differences for both 2021-2020 and 2020-2019 are used (for the same reasons)<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Alongside this, the CRM uses MFRI’s composite measure of household-level risk (made up of changes to household debt-to-GDP ratios and unemployment rates during the previous quarter). Lastly, the CRM makes use of a wealth of information gathered through the ongoing COVID phone surveys. In consultation with the Poverty and Equity GP, a prototype index is added compiling information from a selection of relevant questions included in the phone surveys. Thresholds for each indicator are assigned in consultation with the Prospects team, Poverty and Equity GP and Development Data Group. |

| | | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> Suitable alternatives for social-economic vulnerability are actively being considered together with DEC and Poverty and Equity GP. One option may be in including estimates of inequality as a proxy for increased vulnerability in lower income quantiles. However, forward looking estimates for inequality are not currently available. Instead, estimates of forecasted unemployment are included as an indicator with close overlaps as a driver of inequality. |

| | <strong>Rationale:</strong> Choice of indicators for measuring pre-existing health security capacity remains contentious. Prior to the pandemic, the most comprehensive and commonly referred to metric for pandemic preparedness was the Global Health Security Index (GHS). The measure is a composite index combining 85 sub-indicators (across 6 health categories) with expert solicitation of a panel of 21 leading health experts. While the measure is undoubtedly comprehensive, it has proven a relatively poor correlate of present day COVID exposure and response. Much of this is witnessed by heavy rates of incidence and impact in Europe and North America, coupled with lower-than-expected impacts in parts of Africa and South East Asia. With that in mind, and in consultation with the Health GP, the CRM includes the GHS Index alongside a COVID-specific metric developed by the European Union’s Joint Research Centre INFORM initiative. The INFORM COVID Risk Index is an adaptation of the INFORM initiative’s Epidemic Risk Index – used to support prioritization of preparedness and early response actions for the primary impacts of the pandemic. The two inputs are aggregated together, with high-risk thresholds assigned by the GCRP team in consultation with Health GP. | |
| | | <strong>Data hierarchy:</strong> Level 1: All source indicators are assigned Level 1 |
| | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> Alternatives were considered in the form of the Epidemic Preparedness Index (Oppenheim et al. 2018). However, many similar indexes are less comprehensive than the GHS and suffer from the same lack of correlation in predicting the country-level impacts of COVID. | |
| | | <strong>Rationale:</strong> The primary measure of emerging health risk is provided by the WHO’s Disease Outbreak News (DONs) alerts – a real-time system providing information on all disease outbreaks notified to the WHO. Given the prominence of COVID in affecting global health system, the CRM makes use of several COVID-monitoring tools. To begin with, indicators of COVID incidence are chosen in the form of bi-weekly changes in both case counts and deaths (including numbers per 1M and growth rates). In addition to exposure, response capacities are factored in through three policy trackers provided by Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Governance: the Government Response Index and Lockdown Rollback Index. |

| | | <strong>Alternatives considered:</strong> A large number of metrics exist in tracking the impacts of COVID. Alternatives that may add value to future iterations of the CRM include: excess mortality and test positivity rates. Gaps in data coverage and quality limit their inclusion at the present. Given the changing nature of COVID’s impacts on Global health systems, the CRM will periodically review choice and prominence of COVID metrics in consultation with the WB’s Health GP. Inclusion of other suitable metrics such as vaccination coverage are currently being explored. Additionally, this risk dimension will continue to be explored, especially as the impacts of COVID are expected to diminish over time – through 2021 and beyond. |

<p><strong>The next step in the process is normalizing each indicator on a scale from 0 – 10.</strong> In doing so, the CRM assigns each indicator an upper and lower bound based on high and low risk thresholds. In most cases, expert elicitation is used to define bounds for the min-max normalization process. All indicator values above the upper threshold are then assigned a value of 10 (and considered high risk); values below the lower threshold are assigned 0 (considered little-to-no risk); and all other values receive a normalized score that falls somewhere in-between (using the formula below). The normalized procedure is described below, where <span class="math inline">\(\text{Indicato}\text{rRaw}_{i}\)</span> represents a country’s score for a given indicator <em>i</em> (for all values in-between the threshold bounds). <span class="math inline">\(\text{ThresholdLowe}r_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{ThresholdUppe}r_{i}\)</span> are the designated lower and upper thresholds for respective indicators and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Indicato}\text{rNorm}_{i}\)</span> is the normalized indicator score ranging from 0-10.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Indicato}\text{rNorm}_{i}\  = \ \frac{\text{\ Indicato}\text{rRaw}_{i} - \ ThresholdUpper_{i}}{\text{ThresholdUppe}r_{i} - ThresholdLower_{i}}*10\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Where possible, the CRM seeks to align upper and lower bounds with risk thresholds used by other WB teams or based on widespread expert consensus.</strong> There are three exceptions to this procedure, requiring some degree of subjective interpretation. Firstly, where no expert consensus on risk thresholds exist, normalized bounds are assigned via percentiles (typically 95<sup>th</sup>/5<sup>th</sup>). Secondly, in cases where pre-existing vulnerability <em>categories</em> are specified, or where differences between risk categories are non-linear, the CRM defaults to using expert-defined categories as the basis of indicator scores. For example, the World Bank’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) rates countries’ likelihood of external debt distress in three categories: Low; Moderate; and High. In this case, the CRM manually aligns scores with the DSA categories (using values of 3, 7 and 10 respectively). Lastly, in instances where binary indicator outcomes exist – e.g. whether a drought is ongoing or not – the CRM simply assigns a 10 or 0, with no normalized values in-between.</p>
<p><strong>There are three reasons for transforming raw indicator scores using bounded normalization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It allows for ease of comparability across indicators – with all scores falling between 0-10;</p></li>
<li><p>It reduces the influence of outliers. Many sources of risk information are heavily skewed, and provision of upper and lower bounds helps to diminish their influence on all intermediary scores (note that that this can also be addressed using Z-scores); and</p></li>
<li><p>It allows for simple and transparent identification of high/low risk countries. A score of 10 means that a country has exceeded the designated threshold for the respective indicator, a 0 reflects a country that is considered very low risk. This simplicity of interpretation is of particular use when it comes to aggregating indicators together to form a single score for each dimension of compound risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STEP 3: Indicator aggregation</strong></p>
<p><strong>After the normalization procedure, indicators are grouped and aggregated by risk dimension to generate an individual risk score for all six dimensions of compound risk. Separate scores are assigned for Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Risk.</strong> The simplest and most transparent way of aggregating scores is to take the maximum value across grouped risk indicators for each given dimension.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[RiskDimension = \ \max_{i = 1\ldots n}\left\{ \text{Indicato}\text{rNorm}_{i} \right\}\]</span></p>
<p>Here<span class="math inline">\(\text{\ RiskDimension}\)</span> is the score for a given dimension of compound risk <em>r,</em> with the maximum score for all normalized indicators (<span class="math inline">\(\text{Indicato}\text{rNorm}_{i})\)</span> selected across the suite <em>(i= 1…n</em>)<em>.</em> For example, if a given country’s food security is made up of three source indicators (with scores of 5, 7, and 8 respectively), then food security risk will simply be listed as the highest value in the suite (8 in this case). In each of these cases, normalized values are aligned with the upper (and lower) bounds defined by expert elicitation and represent high (and low) risk. The process mimics the methodology of a number of similar risk monitoring systems, including the WB’s Macro-Financial Risk Index. This step results in a score for each dimension of compound risk ranging from 0-10. A risk dimension with a score of 10 implies that at least one of the grouped indicators in the dimension is above the risk threshold.</p>
<p><strong>In some instances, dimensions consist of indicators with variable quality. For example, a selection of inputs may be high-quality with limited geographic coverage. Others may reflect weaker proxies but provide data for all countries.</strong> In such instances, a hierarchy of data inputs is specified (see Tables 1 and Annex Tables 1-2). Firstly, the nature of the data hierarchy is established, typically by grouping indicators into two levels: Level 1 (consisting of high-quality low coverage indicators) and Level 2 (lower quality higher coverage). For dimensions that use a data hierarchy, scores are assigned solely on the basis of Level 1 indicators wherever country data exists (i.e. the maximum value of all Level 1 indicators). In countries where no Level 1 data is available, the CRM reverts to aggregating Level 2 data instead. For example, in the case of the Food Security component, FEWS NET is used as a Level 1 data source meaning that in countries where available information exists FEWS NET ratings take precedence. In cases where data is unavailable, the CRM falls back on food price volatility data (gathered by the WB’s Food Price Monitor) as a proxy for food insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>While this aggregation method is very easy to implement and interpret, methodological simplicity inherently comes with tradeoffs</strong>. In this case, sole use of max values means that false positives are more likely than with other methods. For example, if a chosen country’s three food security indicators are observed as 10, 2 and 3 respectively, then the max score of 10 would fail to represent this diversity. This is especially problematic in examples where there may be a large number of source indicators in a given dimension of compound risk (and therefore higher likelihood that at least one score is a 10), or where poor proxies are used (that may not be in line with the suite of other indicators). Similarly, a max system does little to differentiate between the severity of high-risk countries. Returning to the same food security example, a country with scores of 10, 10 and 10 would be rated the same as the previous example of 10, 2 and 3. Finally, use of a data hierarchy means that cross-country comparisons can be problematic as different countries may use different data inputs. Given the alternative of limiting information to only countries with the highest-quality data, and perhaps misrepresenting the geographic spread of risk further, the CRM adopts the hierarchy approach while seeking to clearly communicate all sources of inputs.</p>
<p><strong>One alternative would be to use an average of grouped indicators, either using a geometric or arithmetic mean (for more details on optional averaging methods see Annex Supplementary Text 1).</strong> While this provides a more consistent representation of risk across the suite of grouped indicators, an averaging method similarly has weaknesses. For example, signaled changes in risk conditions often materialize in one aspect of risk, before showing up in others. This can be clearly seen in the case of COVID’s influence on the Health dimension. Increasing risk is first reflected in rising cases. This is typically followed by a lagged increase in deaths and (barring preventative measures) policy and fiscal responses. An average of indicators tracking each element separately would be unlikely to pick up on high-risk countries until all indicators were reflecting adverse conditions. In addition, averaging can lead to skewed interpretations when a large number of binary indicators are used (as is the case for a number of the risk dimensions). Lastly, use of an average requires selection of relatively arbitrary high-risk thresholds for risk dimensions (as a threshold of 10 would be unrealistically high in expecting all grouped indicators to be above the high-risk thresholds).</p>
<p><strong>Given that the CRM is designed as a flagging system, signaling potential changes in emerging threats conditions rather than generating a precise risk index, use of a max value system is chosen as a default</strong>. However, users will be able to access and download all data inputs within the CRM and apply their own aggregation methods if appropriate to their needs. In addition, the CRM team will use the initial phase of implementation to review and validate the choice of default aggregation method.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4: Generating Overall Alert Flags</strong></p>
<p><strong>While information from Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Threat scores are useful in and of themselves, many users of the CRM will want to know weigh recent threats against a country’s underlying capacity to deal with risk. As such, the CRM produces a third score (termed “Overall Alert Flags”) for each risk dimension by combining Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Threats scores using a geometric mean.</strong> The approach provides a broad overview of the level of alertness needed in weighing the importance of changing risk conditions relative to a country’s coping capacity: i.e. a gauge of vigilance required in monitoring ongoing (or upcoming) in the months ahead relative to normal conditions. With that in mind, combining vulnerability and emerging threat elements ensures that countries that have seen a modest increase in emerging threats, but low levels of underlying vulnerability are weighted downwards, while those that have seen slight increases in emerging threats, but high overall levels of underlying vulnerability are weighted upwards.</p>
<p>The CRM’s proposed method is very similar to approaches taken by INFORM and other multi-dimensional risk indexes. Here <span class="math inline">\(\text{RiskDriver}\text{Max}_{r}\)</span> is the emerging threats score for dimension <em>r,</em> and underlying vulnerability is represented by <span class="math inline">\(\text{ExistingRis}k_{r}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{AlertLevel}_{r} = \sqrt[2]{\text{RiskDimension}\text{Max}_{r} \bullet ExistingRisk_{r}}\]</span></p>
<p>This results in a score ranging from 0-10, which can similarly be further grouped into three broad categories. Scores ranging from 7-10 are deemed to represent a high-alert status, scores between 5-7 are seen as medium alert status and scores between 0-5 considered low-alert status.</p>
<p><strong>The combined score should be considered a more accurate reflection of the level of alertness needed in monitoring and responding to given risks – one that permits comparisons across countries in a more direct manner than for simple use of the Emerging Threats score</strong> (which charts changing risk conditions relative to the norm). The benefits of combining scores from Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Threats into a single high-level measure can be seen in how the approach weighs the two scores together. Despite the need for vigilance in any context facing intensification of emerging threats, alert levels are likely to be far reduced in countries with low levels of vulnerability (owing to the fact that severe crises are less likely). Similarly, concern should be far higher whenever a vulnerable country experiences a worsening of risk conditions (even if a slight or moderate). Indeed, in the context of a supporting early action for crisis risk prevention these are typically the countries and contexts of primary interest. It is, however, worth remembering that the CRM is designed as a flagging system, not a predictive tool. A high Overall Alert Flag score does not mean that a compound crisis is expected to materialize. Instead, it signals the preconditions and catalytic environment for one.</p>
<p><strong>Use of a geometric average seeks to better account for the close relationship between underlying vulnerability and emerging threats, as well as the fact that outcomes and likely to be multiplicative.</strong> The same approach is used in a number of other risk metrics (including INFORM), and well supported in the wider risk literature – see Guillaumont (2009). However, it is important to note that Overall Alert Flags can similarly be calculated using a number of the alternative methods – such as an arithmetic mean or max value). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses (a detailed discussion and comparison of different options is presented in Section 3.2).</p>
<p><strong>STEP 5: Determining country level scores for underlying vulnerability, emerging threats and overall alert flags</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alongside separate scores for all six risk dimensions, the CRM also assigns country-level scores summarizing risk profiles for Underlying vulnerability, Emerging Threats and Overall Alert Flags.</strong> These are done by summing (or “flagging”) the total number of risk dimensions classified as high (or high + medium) within a given country. While use of a combined metric helps to put a country’s current (and future) risk conditions into perspective, care should be taken in interpreting Overall Alert Flags given the fact that indicators (and thresholds) Underlying vulnerability and Emerging Threats are not wholly compatible across all risk dimensions. For this reason, the CRM present all three country-level scores separately, allowing the user to determine which measure is of most relevance given the intended use.</p>
<p>The most straightforward method is to assign a “1” for each risk dimension classified as high risk. For example, if a country has Emerging Threat flags for food security and socio-economic vulnerability (i.e. scores of 10 across both risk dimensions), then the country’s Emerging Threat score will be 2.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{RiskDimensionHig}h_{r} = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ RiskDimensionCategory_{r} = HighRisk \\
0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ RiskDimensionCategory_{r} \neq HighRisk \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{TotalCompoundRis}k_{c} = \sum_{r = 1}^{6}{\text{RiskDimensionHig}h_{r}}\]</span></p>
<p>This results in a single country-level score ranging from 0-6. A score of 6 (or 6 risk flags as referred to in the CRM) simply implies that all six dimensions are considered high risk. The method tells us how many dimensions are considered high-risk and can be used to gauge whether multiple preconditions exist for emerging compound crises. It is easy to compute, and above all, simple to interpret: a country’s score (whether for Underlying vulnerability, Emerging Threats or Overall Alert Flags) is equivalent to the number of high-risk dimensions for a given country. It also allows for the status of emerging compound risk to be readily compared, both within and across countries – noting the various methodological caveats outlined above.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of risk dimensions into categories differ slightly between Underlying vulnerability, Emerging Threats and Overall Alert Flags owing to the different aggregation methods used.</strong> Risk dimension scores of 10 are classified as high risk For Underlying vulnerability and Emerging Threats, implying that at least one of the grouped indicators is about the high-risk threshold (based on the Max Value approach). Dimensions scores ranging from 7-10 are deemed medium risk. For Overall Alert Flags, risk dimensions with scores ranging between 7-10 are labelled high risk owing to the fact that scores are derived from a combination of Vulnerability and Emerging Threat elements. Dimensions with scores from 5-7 are therefore classified as medium risk.</p>
<p><strong>Given that risk is seldom (if ever) binary, a second approach is to assign an intermediary score for all medium-risk countries.</strong> This recognizes the limitations of assigning a 0 to all dimensions below the high-risk threshold. Indeed, countries with dimension scores just under the high-risk threshold are likely to be of much higher risk than those far below the lower threshold. Accordingly, the CRM calculates an alternative measure of overall underlying vulnerability and emerging threats by assigning a half-value to medium-level risks.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{RiskDimensionHig}\text{hMed}_{r} = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RiskDimensionCategory_{r} = HighRisk \\
0.5\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RiskDimensionCategory_{r} = MedRisk \\
0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RiskDimensionCategory_{r} = LowRisk \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \ \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{TotalCompoundRis}k_{c} = \sum_{r = 1}^{6}{\text{RiskDimensionsHig}\text{hMed}_{r}}\]</span></p>
<p>In this instance, compound risk<span class="math inline">\(\ (TotalCompoundRisk\)</span>) in country <em>c,</em> is calculated as the sum of all medium-risk dimensions (assigned a 0.5) and high-risk dimensions (assigned a 1). For example, a country with a high-risk flag for Health and a medium-risk flag for Food security would be listed as having a total of 1.5 compound risk flags. This isn’t as intuitive as the previous setup. However, it is still relatively easy to interpret and communicate. More importantly, a combination of high and medium risk flags provides a more holistic representation of underling risk conditions. Users will able to differentiate between the two methods (i.e. high-risk only and medium + high-risk) using the CRM database and interactive Dashboard. For this reason, <strong>the combined medium and high-risk flagging system is used as the default for the remainder of this Note</strong><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While the CRM is based on a simple sum of risk flags as a means of promoting ease of interpretability and transparency, a number of aggregation options exist</strong>. For example, the CRM team also considered use of an averaging method. Country-level score could be calculated as the average of the six dimension-level scores. However, this approach suffers from many of the same weaknesses as use of averaging methods in deciding individual dimension-level scores. In particular, compound crises tend to occur when underlying dimensions of risk are above a country’s coping capacity (i.e. above high-risk thresholds). They can also occur when just two or three dimensions of compound risk interact – even if conditions in other dimensions are relatively stable. For example, a country with three emerging dimensions above the high-risk threshold (i.e. scores of 10) and three dimensions below the high-risk threshold (i.e. scores of 0) would only have an average overall emerging threats score of 5 despite displaying heightened preconditions for compound risk (recognizing that average emerging threats scores would range from 0-10 rather than 0-6). Instead, use of the flagging system clearly highlights instances where coping capacities are likely to be exceeded across any of the six dimensions and does not dilute overall results when other dimensions might be experiencing normal (or below-normal) risk conditions. For this reason, the CRM is built around a max-value flagging system. However, users are free to download the data manually and adjust the methodology accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 5: Cross-validation, expert elicitation and continual updating</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally, expert elicitation is used to complement the CRM’s outputs before they are shared with end users.</strong> The expertise and judgement of WB sectoral experts is an essential element of the overall CRM methodology, guiding indicator selection, aggregation as well as identification of appropriate thresholds. Furthermore, before they are shared with end users, quantitative results from the CRM will be cross-checked by WB sector and regional experts to detect anomalies in the flag-based system, as well as to complement the CRM’s findings with rich qualitative insights from a range of WB experts.</p>
<p><strong>To support this expert elicitation process, a Technical Steering Group will be set up building on the informal working level consultations conducted during the methodological design phase.</strong> The Steering Group will allow for continuous expert inputs into the CRM methodology as well as review of CRM outputs. The Steering Group will include at least one focal point for each of the six dimensions of compound risk and it is expected that it will be convened quarterly as part of the GCRP’s horizon scanning exercises</p>
