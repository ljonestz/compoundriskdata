[["introduction.html", "Compound Risk Monitor 1 Introduction", " Compound Risk Monitor GCRP 1 Introduction Countries face an increasingly complex risk landscape. The impact of a single shock—an earthquake, a food crisis, or a disease outbreak—can amplify existing stressors or potentially initiate a cascade of shocks, leading to larger and more sustained impacts on lives, livelihoods, and development outcomes. With the potential to cause significant economic impacts, complex crises can hinder progress in poverty reduction, especially in low-income and fragile countries. The ongoing COVID pandemic is a prime example of a complex crisis with considerable adverse consequences on economies in both high- and low-income countries. Not only is the pandemic reducing the ability of countries to respond to wider threats, the occurrence of any additional shocks (whether natural, political or economic) during the COVID crisis is likely to hinder the recovery process, further entrench existing vulnerabilities, and significantly roll back development gains.

These six dimensions can be seen as preconditions (or catalysts) likely to contribute to compounding effects. Each dimension integrates aspects related to exposure, vulnerability and response capacity. For each dimension of compound risk, the CRM provides: a) a static overview of a country’s predisposition to specific threats, typically based on an evaluation of structural conditions and underlying capacities related to each risk dimension (“underlying vulnerability”); b) a dynamic view of changing risk conditions – signaling countries that are experiencing (or are expected to experience) worsening/intensification of risk conditions (“emerging threats”); and c) a combined score that weighs emerging threats against a country’s level of coping capacity and that can be seen as a high-level guide of the vigilance needed in monitoring and responding to changing risk conditions in a given country (“overall alert flags”). 4.1 Natural Hazards 4.2 Food Security 4.3 Conflict and Fragility 4.4 Macro-Fiscal Dynamics 4.5 Socio-economic Vulnerability 4.6 Health "],["acknowledgments.html", "5 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", " 5 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This note was prepared by a team comprising Bianca Adam, Lindsey Jones, Nicola Ranger and Thibault Bouessel du Bourg, under the guidance of Nabila Assaf.
